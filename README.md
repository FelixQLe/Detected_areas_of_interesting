# Approach to the problem

##### To keep this approach easy to follow and understand, I decide devide problem into steps, each step tackle with each areas of interests
1. Understand the Problem
    - research to have certan level of the problem
2. Divide areas of interests into subs(steps)
    - Concentrate on solving one sub at a time
    - more manageable
    - a distinct way to solve of each sub

3. Iterate and Refine
    - revisit and refine your solution.  
    - improvements and adjustments as we gain a deeper understanding.
    - able to write a full function to repeatedly using

4. Test and Validate
    - Test the complete solution to verify that it meets the requirements and effectively addresses the initial the problem

5. Optimize
    - Look for ways to optimize your solution
    - This could involve improving efficiency, reducing complexity, or enhancing overall performance.

6. Document
    - Document your solution, including the rationale behind your decisions and any insights gained during the problem-solving process
